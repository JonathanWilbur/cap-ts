I think you will want this for generating the alerts: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlbuilder2
... and this for parsing them: https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlparser2

... Actually, this can be used to parse and build XML: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js

## To Do

- [ ] Include encoding header
- [ ] Test XML encoding and decoding more
- [ ] Ensure proper capitalization is used.
